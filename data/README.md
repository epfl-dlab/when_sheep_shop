# Data

We will be happy to share the data used for this article if requested. You can request three different types of data:

- **Raw data**: All the HTML files that have been crawled from RateBeer and BeerAdvocate.
- **Parsed data**: Parsed files from RateBeer and BeerAdvocate. For both websites, you can get a txt.gz file with all the reviews on the website as well as a csv with all the beers, a csv with all the breweries and a csv with all the users. If you want to have a look at the data, you can check the two repositories hosting the code to crawl: [BeerAdvocate crawler](https://github.com/glederrey/beeradvocate_crawler) and [RateBeer crawler](https://github.com/glederrey/ratebeer_crawler). The two repositories will give some insight about the data that have been crawled.
- **Matched data**: You can also request the data after matching (after running [1-matching](https://github.com/epfl-dlab/when_sheep_shop/blob/master/code/notebooks/1-matching.ipynb)).

If you need access to one (or more) of these datasets, please contact the authors: [Gael Lederrey](mailto:gael.lederrey@epfl.ch) and [Robert West](mailto:robert.west@epfl.ch).
